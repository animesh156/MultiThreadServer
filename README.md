# MultiThreaded vs SingleThreaded Java Server

This project demonstrates the difference between a **Single Threaded Server** and a **Multi Threaded Server** using Java's `ServerSocket` and `Socket` APIs.

The goal is to showcase how multi-threading allows a server to handle multiple clients concurrently, compared to a single-threaded approach that blocks further requests until the current one is handled.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
MultiThreadServer/
â”œâ”€â”€ single-thread/        # Contains single-threaded server and client
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SingleThreadServer.java
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SingleThreadClient.java
â”œâ”€â”€ multi-thread/         # Contains multi-threaded server and client
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MultiThreadServer.java

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### âœ… Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Any IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse) or terminal for running `.java` files

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

### ðŸ§µ SingleThreadedServer
- Accepts one client at a time.
- Each client must wait for the previous one to disconnect before being served.
- Simpler to implement, but not scalable.

### ðŸ§µ MultiThreadedServer
- Spawns a new thread for each client connection.
- Can serve multiple clients **simultaneously**.
- More efficient for concurrent requests.

---

## ðŸ”¨ How to Run

### 1. Compile the Server and Client
```bash
javac SingleThreadServer.java
javac SingleThreadClient.java

javac MultiThreadServer.java
javac MultiThreadClient.java
```

### 2. Run the Server
```bash
java SingleThreadServer
# or
java MultiThreadServer
```

### 3. Run the Clients (in different terminals or threads)
```bash
java SingleThreadClient
# or
java MultiThreadClient
```
